# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

## Introduction

Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It was introduced by Edward Farhi, Jeffrey Goldstone, and Sam Gutmann in 2014.

## Problem Definition

Consider an optimization problem with an objective function \(C\) defined over a set of binary variables \(\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\). The goal is to find the binary vector \(\mathbf{x}\) that minimizes or maximizes the objective function \(C(\mathbf{x})\).

## QAOA Overview

QAOA constructs a parameterized quantum circuit to approximate the ground state of a cost Hamiltonian associated with the optimization problem. The algorithm involves two main steps:

1. **Quantum State Preparation:**
   - Prepare a quantum state \(|\gamma, \beta\rangle\) using a variational quantum circuit.
   - The parameters \(\gamma\) and \(\beta\) are optimized to minimize the expectation value of the cost Hamiltonian.

   \[
   |\gamma, \beta\rangle = U(\gamma, \beta) |+\rangle^{\otimes n}
   \]

2. **Measure Expectation Values:**
   - Measure the expectation values of the cost Hamiltonian \(H_C\) and a mixer Hamiltonian \(H_B\).

   \[
   \langle C \rangle = \langle \gamma, \beta | H_C | \gamma, \beta \rangle
   \]

   \[
   \langle B \rangle = \langle \gamma, \beta | H_B | \gamma, \beta \rangle
   \]

## QAOA Circuit

The QAOA circuit consists of alternating layers of single-qubit rotations and entangling gates. For a given optimization problem, the circuit depth is determined by the number of layers \(p\).

\[
U(\gamma, \beta) = \prod_{p=1}^{P} e^{-i\beta_p B} e^{-i\gamma_p C}
\]

## Example: MaxCut Problem

Let's consider the MaxCut problem as an example. Given an undirected graph \(G = (V, E)\), the goal is to find a cut in the graph that maximizes the number of edges crossing the cut.

### Python Implementation

```python
from qiskit import Aer, QuantumCircuit, transpile, assemble
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
from qiskit.aqua.operators import WeightedPauliOperator
from qiskit.aqua.operators.expectations import PauliExpectation, AerPauliExpectation

# Define the MaxCut problem as a weighted graph
graph = [(0, 1, 1.0), (1, 2, 1.0), (2, 3, 1.0), (3, 0, 1.0)]

# Create the QAOA circuit
p = 1  # Number of layers
gamma, beta = symbols('gamma beta')
qaoa_circuit = qaoa_maxcut(graph, p, gamma, beta)

# Visualize the circuit
qaoa_circuit.draw(output='mpl')
